What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	Git creates a directory called .git
	You need to do that so git can track your changes.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	It sits in between the working directory and the repository, like a waiting room for files that need to be committed.  I can put all the files that I've made related changes in into the staging area and commit them together.
